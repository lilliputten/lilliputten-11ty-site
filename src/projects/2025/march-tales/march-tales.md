We've finally launched the first public release of our recent project: a mobile application and a web-site for The March Cat Tales.

-->

{% import "macros.njk" as macros with context %}

[**The March Cat Tales**](https://tales.march.team/) is a multi-component project designed to deliver author-narrated fairy tales and stories through a **mobile application**, **web interface**, and **REST API server**. Built with modern technologies, it prioritizes seamless cross-device experiences, internationalization, and user-centric design.

The project is designed to provide the user with a convenient way to listen to fairy tales, legends, and short stories, narrated by the artist, â€” in one place. (Currently only in Russian.)

Both the mobile app and the web server are still in MVP status. See TODO section at the end.

## Mobile Application

The **Flutter-based mobile app** is the main component of the project, and offers an immersive listenning experience with robust audio controls.

The application is on the 'closed testing' stage in the Google Play Store.

{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/rubric-info-light.jpg', 'Rubric info (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/settings-page.jpg', 'Settings page (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/tag-info-light.jpg', 'Tag info (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/track-details.jpg', 'Track details (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/tracks-list-light.jpg', 'Tracks list (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/tracks-list-with-a-player.jpg', 'Tracks list with a player (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/phone/tracks-list-without-panels-furing-scroll.jpg', 'Tracks list without panels during scroll (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselEnd() }}

### Key Features:

- **Audio Playback**: Powered by **Just Audio**, with background service support for notification controls.
- **Favorites Management**: Local storage or cloud sync via the API server.
- **Internationalization & Theming**: Multi-language support and basic customization options.

## Web Interface

The web interface is a **Django-powered frontend** that serves as a companion to the mobile app and as an administrative interface to the database. It uses Django template system with **Webpack** for client-side asset building (via SCSS and TypeScript).

The administrative panel is implemented using the built-in django admin functional and is complemented by **django-unfold**.

### Web Interface Screenshots

{{ macros.carouselBegin('shots-slider full-width', type='browserScreenshotsWide') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/author-details.jpg', 'Author details.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/authors-list.jpg', 'Authors list.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/language-menu.jpg', 'Language menu.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/page-header.jpg', 'Page header.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/track-details.jpg', 'Track details.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-2/user-menu.jpg', 'User menu.') }}
{{ macros.carouselEnd() }}

### Key Features:

- **Simple Navigation**: Intuitive and easy viewing of fairy tales.
- **Local Favorites**: Users can save favorite tracks without an account.
- **Internationalization**: Supports multiple (English and Russian at the moment) languages for global accessibility.
- **Authorization Integration**: Syncs favorites (and potentially other essential data) with the API server if the users has been already logged in. Implemented with **django-allauth** and **django-registration**. Supports third-party oauth accounts (only Google at the moment has implemented).
- **Administrative Panel**: A convenient custom website control panel implemented with **django-unfold**.
- **Processing of uploaded audio files**: All uploaded audio files are processed using ffmpeg and ffprobe to fetch the audio metadata, and stores duration and file size into the database.
- **Internationalization**: All the models and database are translated internally using **django-translated-fields**, other translations are supported by django native i18n/l10n system.
- **Adaptive preview sizes**: **django-imagekit** is involved to generate audio tracks' author' preview on-the-fly. LQIP ("Low-quality image placeholders") previews are implemented via a dedicated middleware templatetag, which does almost the same as my [Gulp LQIP small image placeholder generator](https://github.com/lilliputten/gulp-embed-lqip-as-background) plugin: generates the image preview in the `style: backgound` with a svg-wrapped thumbnail.

## REST API Server

The API server, also built with **Django** and it's **djangorestframework** and **django-registration**, provides endpoints for both the web interface and mobile application. It handles user authentication, data synchronization, and audio metadata management.

### Account Control Screenshots

{{ macros.carouselBegin('shots-slider full-width', type='browserScreenshotsWide') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-admin/successfully-logged-in.jpg', 'Successfully logged in.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-admin/signin-screen.jpg', 'Signin screen.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-admin/account-control.jpg', 'Account control.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/web-admin/deleting-account.jpg', 'Deleting account.') }}
{{ macros.carouselEnd() }}

### Key Features:

- **User Authorization**: Secure authentication for syncing favorites across devices.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Efficient data exchange between clients and server.
- **Audio Processing**: Leverages **FFmpeg** and **FFprobe** for track metadata extraction and quality assurance.

### Administrative Panel Screenshots

{{ macros.carouselBegin('shots-slider full-width', type='browserScreenshotsWide') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/admin-2/author-details.jpg', 'Author details.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/admin-2/authors-list.jpg', 'Authors list.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/admin-2/track-edit-page.jpg', 'Track edit page.') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/admin-2/tracks-list.jpg', 'Tracks list.') }}
{{ macros.carouselEnd() }}

## Audio Playback

Both the website and the mobile device have relatively identical audio player behavior:

- The hideable floating player on the bottom of the page.
- Both the website and the mobile application remembers the playback position of each track so that playback can be resumed at any time.
- Playback positions are stored locally or on the server if the user is logged in.
- It supports endless playback when tracks are played one after the other. (Since the application is still in MVP status, it uses fairly simple logic to determine the next track to play.)

## Mobile Tablet Screenshots

{{ macros.carouselBegin('shots-slider full-width', type='browserScreenshotsWide') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/tablet/author-details-light.jpg', 'Author details (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/tablet/author-details.jpg', 'Author details (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/tablet/settings-page-light.jpg', 'Settings page (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/tablet/track-details.jpg', 'Track details (dark theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselItem('./images/tablet/tracks-list-with-a-search-light.jpg', 'Tracks list with a search (light theme).') }}
{{ macros.carouselEnd() }}
#}

## Seamless Cross-Device Experience

- **Local vs. Synced Data**:
  - **Web/Mobile**: Favorites can be stored locally without an account.
  - **Authorized Users**: Sync preferences across devices via the API server.
- **Unified Backend**: Both web and mobile clients share the same API server for data consistency.

## Why This Project Stands Out

[**The March Cat Tales**](https://tales.march.team/) demonstrates full-stack expertise, blending Djangoâ€™s robust backend capabilities with Flutterâ€™s cross-platform flexibility. By separating concerns between the web interface, API server, and mobile app, the project ensures scalability and a cohesive user experience across devices. Whether accessed via browser or mobile, the platform delivers an enchanting storytelling journey with modern tech under the hood.

## TODO

At the moment, the project is at the MVP stage. So now we have a lot of tasks for further development.

### Mobile application
