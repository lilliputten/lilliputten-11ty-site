My name is Igor and I'm a professional front-end developer with 8 years of experience, recently specializing mainly in React, NextJS, NodeJS and Python (with Flask and Django).

## Brief background

I've been involved in creating various types of web applications and sites: from complex dynamic web applications (sometimes with a backend) to static landing pages, developing applications for embedded browsers (below ES5) and vanilla JS, creating ui kits, reusable libraries, and optimizing performance across a variety of devices and browsers, always creating responsive and adaptive layouts by default (on the principle of "mobile first") -- as an independent developer, and as a part of various teams.

## Techs

My current stack for the frontend is React/NextJS (via MobX or Redux) with TypeScript. Previously (about 5-8 years ago) I used i-Bem/Bem-XJST/ENB/Borschik/jQuery stack, and still fond of it (I even once made my own implementation of i-bem/xjst framework for embedded browsers).

For the backend, I use Python (with Flask or Django) or NodeJS (with Express, for a little simpler tasks), some time ago I used PHP (and still use it for inherited projects). (And once upon a time, at the very beginning of my career, I also used Perl.)

I use SCSS or PostCSS (previously it was LESS and Stylus) with MUI or Bootstrap libraries for UI development. I also worked with ChakraUI, Tailwind CSS and Prime React. I also use Storybook for large complex projects, and 11ty for static sites.

## Other info

I'm currently in GMT+5, but probably will move to GMT+2.

My English language proficiency is Intermediate or Upper-Intermediate (approx. at B2 CEFR level).

## For potential employers and partners

I'm really looking for an interesting new job right now.

At the moment, I'm only considering options with remote work or relocation.
