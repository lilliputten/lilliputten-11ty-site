My name is Igor and I'm a professional front-end developer with more than 8 years of experience, recently specializing mainly in React, NextJS, NodeJS and Python (with Flask and Django).

## Brief background

I've been involved in creating various types of web applications and sites: from complex dynamic web applications (sometimes with a backend) to static landing pages, developing applications for embedded browsers (below ES5) and vanilla JS, creating ui kits, reusable libraries, and optimizing performance across a variety of devices and browsers, always creating responsive and adaptive layouts by default (on the principle of "mobile first") -- as an independent developer, and as a part of various teams.

## Techs

My current stack for the frontend is React/NextJS (via MobX or Redux) with TypeScript. In my own projects, I usually use TypeScript even for raw JS code (via jsdoc/tsc/tsconfig).

I also have worked with other fornt-end frameworks and technologies like Vue and Svelte. And previously (before 2018) I used i-Bem/Bem-XJST/ENB/Borschik/jQuery/Stylus stack, and still fond of it (I even once made my own implementation of i-bem/xjst framework for embedded browsers). And, of course, I have a deep experience with vanilla JS.

I use different CSS libraries: Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, MUI (have an experience with ChakraUI and Prime React). I prefer to use SCSS (and/or scss modules) if possible. I also use Storybook for large complex projects, and 11ty or gulp for static sites.

For the backend, I use Python (with Flask or Django) or NodeJS (with Express, for a little simpler tasks), some time ago I used PHP (and still use it for inherited projects). (And once upon a time, at the very beginning of my career, I also used Perl.)

In the past (during 2016-2023), I participated in the development of complex GIS and IoT projects as a member of the team.

I've recently started developing mobile apps using Flutter.

## Other info

Currently at GMT+3, but ready to move.

I'm not a native English speaker. Apparently, my English language proficiency is nearly Upper-Intermediate (approx. at B2 CEFR level).

## For potential employers and partners

I'm really looking for an interesting new job right now.

At the moment, I'm mainly considering options with remote work, but ready to discuss relocation and partial/full on-site options.
