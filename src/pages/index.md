Hello! My name is Igor, and I'm a front-end and full-stack developer with
nearly a decade of experience. I specialize in crafting dynamic web
applications using JavaScript (mostly with TypeScript and React), Python (Django, Flask), and
related technologies.

Dive into [my story](/about/), explore the various [projects](/projects/) I've
brought to life, and don't hesitate to [reach out to me](/contacts/) if you
have any questions or suggestions. Recently I also decided to occasionally
drop some technical [articles](/articles/), related to my daily tasks.
