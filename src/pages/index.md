Hello! My name is Igor, and I'm a front-end and full-stack developer with nearly a decade of experience. I specialize in crafting dynamic web applications using JavaScript (mostly with TypeScript and React), Python, and related technologies.

Dive into [my story](/about/), explore the various [projects](/projects/) I've brought to life,
and don't hesitate to [reach out to me](/contacts/) if you have any questions or suggestions.

Let's build something amazing together!
